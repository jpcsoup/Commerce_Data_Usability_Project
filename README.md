# Commerce_Data_Usability_Project

This repo is QMSS's contribution for the Commerce Data Usability Project.
Let's use the READ_ME file as a timeline, keeping a record of our contributions over time.
If you're adding a file just insert your name, date, and a small intro to a recent contribution:

*1/27*  
Jonathan Campbell: Created GitHub repo and added the READ_ME file

*1/28*
Steve Lee: Added data table Shiny application. Download the server.R and ui.R into a folder along with the data sets (currently the data table includes only the commodity flows and foreign trade data). Once you have all the files in a single folder, open up ui.R in Rstudio and just click 'run app'. It should work.... >_>
This is just a start - Please feel free to edit and add datasets and other functionalities, or just let me know and I can add them.

*2/4*
Schinria Islam: Created starter code for team, joining Commodity Flows and Foreign Trade data by export final destination Canada or Mexico.

*2/10*
Laura Uguccioni: Added a shapefile for US counties, merged the counties representing the same CFS area, mapped some characteristics of the Commodity Flows Survey (could include the joined shapefiles and final map due to large size but my .Rmd file contains instructions). Renamed number-codes representing names of industries, locations, mode of transports, and states.
